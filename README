WELCOME!

This is a simple README just to tell you the gist. This is a game.. Engine. It
is supposed to be an engine for a Zelda-style adventure game with real-time
overworld and shit. It's unfinished so don't think it's done.

More will come.

ATTENTION:
In order to test this code, you must download and install Löve2D. A 2D game
engine creation enviroment blah blah blah. Just download it.

http://love2d.org/

Next, drag the folder these files are in onto the Löve application icon. It will
run.

Alternatively...

If on OS X:
Rename the folder with a .love extension. You will then be able to double-click
to run.

If on Windows or OS X or Linux:
Open this folder (You already have), select everything, at least main.lua and
the game folder and ZIP the files into an archive. Make sure the main.lua file
and game folder are at the root of the ZIP. Then rename the .zip with .love. You
will then be able to double-click to run as well.
